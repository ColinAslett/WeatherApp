## June 21st Update
Just uploaded a huge revamp of the whole project. Currently in the works of another major revamp of the downloader/data class to make it easier for charts and forecast to be drawn on the main frame. Once I finish this revamp the project I want to add NOAA NBM and MOS, though that is low priorty right now because of the differences in those relative to the other models.
